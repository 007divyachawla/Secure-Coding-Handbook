# Secure Coding Handbook

Welcome to the **Secure Coding Handbook!** Here, you will find everything that I have found on secure coding: best practices, analyzing, and, of course, patching **code-related** vulnerabilities. All of the enumerated attacks and defensive techniques are strictly related to web applications. \(for now :\) \)

Making mistakes is human nature, fortunately. Please note that I am by no means an expert and should you find something that is totally erroneous or deviated from the subject, please [create an issue here](https://github.com/joswha/Secure-Coding-Handbook/issues).
